TODO
- Use datatypes instead of strings and tuples (in a [smell-spec](https://github.com/davidpdrsn/smell-spec) fashion)
- Add matchers for more types and formatters for output (see [sml-testing](https://github.com/kvalle/sml-testing))
- Add watch capability (see [stupid](https://github.com/teebrz/stupid))
