TODO
- Use datatypes instead of strings and tuples (see [smell-spec](https://github.com/davidpdrsn/smell-spec))
- Display time to run tests (again, see [smell-spec](https://github.com/davidpdrsn/smell-spec))
- Add a When construct to enable better specification of context for specs (yet again, see [smell-spec](https://github.com/davidpdrsn/smell-spec))
- Add matchers for more types and formatters for output (see [sml-testing](https://github.com/kvalle/sml-testing))
- Add watch capability (see [stupid](https://github.com/teebrz/stupid))
- Change so that progress dots are printed sequentially instead of printing everything at once
- Change so that "it" is given the value of the last failing spec, so the repl can represent polymorphic values used in a comparison e.g. for toBe
